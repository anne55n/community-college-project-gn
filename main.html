                <p class = "intro"> Community colleges are centers of educational opportunity. Community colleges always have been inclusive institutions that welcome all who desire to learn, regardless of wealth, heritage, or previous academic experience. The process of making higher education available to the maximum number of people continues to evolve at 1,167 public and independent community colleges. </p> 
		<br>
		<p class = "intro">With their open-access model and low tuition rates, community colleges are a
		gateway to opportunity. Nearly half of all undergraduates attend community
		college. That’s a diverse student population with a diverse array of needs. </p>

                 The abstract of their work was the following:<br>
                 LaGCC Earth Surface Temperature project (L-ESTP) was created to develop a sequential algorithm to organize, correct, analyze, and summarize satellite data for estimating the average Earth Surface Temperature (EST) using Matlab and Python software. In addition, LESTP objectives included: (1) conduct five stages of systematic data corrections, including determining, eliminating, and interpolating outliers, in addition to geometric (map and longitude) correction; (2) validate the L-ESTP algorithm result with the ongoing temperature results from NASA and NOAA; (3) improve students' skills and knowledge (research, satellite remote sensing, programming, statistical calculations and tools, communication, team work, reading/writing in discipline, etc)

                The problem of how to double the volume of a cube, also known
                as the Delian problem, has intrigued mathematicians for millennia. The great
	        variety of solutions discovered over the centuries have used diverse tools, mathematical
	        and otherwise. Recently, in 1936, Margherita Piazollo Beloch discovered
		a simple and elegant solution to this question. It uses a single piece of
		paper and a handful of folds. The solution has renewed interest in geometrical
		constructability problems, in particular those that incorporate origami.
		The mission of this research was to rediscover and further develop the Beloch's approach that was applied to cubic equations
		and cube volume doubling problems.
